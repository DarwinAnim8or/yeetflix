# Yeetflix
This is an updated version of the old, open source Netflix Party code.
The current version on their GitHub is not working anymore after Netflix updated their player's design.

This version is one I fixed up in January in 2019, and figured it should be made public in case people want to use it.
I don't know who runs the current public version of Netflix Party, but it doesn't appear to be the original creator or open source.
